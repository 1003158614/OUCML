Machine Learning became one of the hottest domain of Computer Science. Each larger company is either applying Machine Learning or thinking about doing so soon to solve their problems and understand their data sets. That means it’s time to learn about Machine Learning, especially if you’re looking for new Computer Science challenges. A great way to do that is to read a couple of books.

[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449369413/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449369413&linkCode=as2&tag=petacrunch-20&linkId=8669cacfe298d25c2832d9062642dd44) is a gentle introduction into machine learning. It doesn’t assume any knowledge about Python and it introduces fundamental concepts and applications of machine learning, discussing various methods through examples. That’s the best book I’ve ever seen for an entry level Machine Learning Engineer.

# Intermediate Level

If you’ve completed a bunch of machine learning projects for yourself and get accustomed to working with machine learning models, here are the books which will take you further:

[Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1789955750/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1789955750&linkCode=as2&tag=petacrunch-20&linkId=cc65892b0564ce32cee20536fb70b29c) is just a great practical book with a lot of actual examples of code. It starts gently and then proceeds to most recent advance in machine learning and deep learning. It’s very easy to read and will appeal to people at any level as the second edition even goes to cover GANs.

[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0387310738&linkCode=as2&tag=petacrunch-20&linkId=11e0911952bfc7a8adf52b3eae0f461c) goes through all basic algorithms starting with a good statistics revision. It’s mostly concerned on theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and is great as a companion to other, more practical books.

# Expert

At expert level reading scientific papers often is much better than reading books, because knowledge is being updated as we speak. Machine Learning is really living its moment. However it is also great to have a bunch of book references in hand to go into deep learning fully:



![img](https://cy-1256894686.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/2019-12-01-003616.png)

[Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617294438/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617294438&linkCode=as2&tag=petacrunch-20&linkId=fa7304c5324df649a4ba536bd74927d2) was written by a creator of Keras, one of the most popular machine learning libraries in Python. The book starts gently, is very practical, gives pieces of code you can use right away and has in general many useful tips on using deep learning. An absolute must read in deep learning.
